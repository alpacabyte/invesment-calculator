# React Investment Calculator

The project was created by following a tutorial and is designed to help users easily calculate their investments.

The user can input the initial investment in the "Initial Investment" field, the annual investment amount in the "Annual Investment" field, the expected return percentage in the "Expected Return" field, and the investment duration in years in the "Duration" field. The results are displayed in a table, showing the total value of the investment for each year, the interest earned that year, the total interest, and the total invested capital.
